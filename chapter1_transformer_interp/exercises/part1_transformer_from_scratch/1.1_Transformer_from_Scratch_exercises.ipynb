    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Understanding Inputs & Outputs of a Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll take a first look at transformers - what their function is, how information moves inside a transformer, and what inputs & outputs they take.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Understand what a transformer is used for\n",
    "> - Understand causal attention, and what a transformer's output represents—algebra operations on tensors\n",
    "> - Learn what tokenization is, and how models do it\n",
    "> - Understand what logits are, and how to use them to derive a probability distribution over the vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Clean Transformer Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll implement a transformer from scratch, using only PyTorch's tensor operations. This will give us a good understanding of how transformers work, and how to use them. We do this by going module-by-module, in an experience which should feel somewhat similar to last week's ResNet exercises. Much like with ResNets, you'll conclude by loading in pretrained weights and verifying that your model works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Understand that a transformer is composed of attention heads and MLPs, with each one performing operations on the residual stream\n",
    "> * Understand that the attention heads in a single layer operate independently, and that they have the role of calculating attention patterns (which determine where information is moved to & from in the residual stream)\n",
    "> * Learn about & implement the following transformer modules:\n",
    ">     * LayerNorm (transforming the input to have zero mean and unit variance)\n",
    ">     * Positional embedding (a lookup table from position indices to residual stream vectors)\n",
    ">     * Attention (the method of computing attention patterns for residual stream vectors)\n",
    ">     * MLP (the collection of linear and nonlinear transformations which operate on each residual stream vector in the same way)\n",
    ">     * Embedding (a lookup table from tokens to residual stream vectors)\n",
    ">     * Unembedding (a matrix for converting residual stream vectors into a distribution over tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Training a Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you'll learn how to train your transformer from scratch. This will be quite similar to the training loops you wrote for ResNet in your first week.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Understand how to train a transformer from scratch\n",
    "> * Write a basic transformer training loop\n",
    "> * Interpret the transformer's falling cross entropy loss with reference to features of the training data (e.g. bigram frequencies)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Sampling from a Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you'll learn how to sample from a transformer. This will involve implementing a few different sampling methods, and writing a caching system which can reuse computations from previous forward passes to improve your model's text generation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The second half of this section is less important, and you can skip it if you want.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Learn how to sample from a transformer\n",
    ">     * This includes basic methods like greedy search or top-k, and more advanced methods like beam search\n",
    "> * Learn how to cache the output of a transformer, so that it can be used to generate text more efficiently\n",
    ">     * Optionally, rewrite your sampling functions to make use of your caching methods"

The prediction of what comes after token 50 is only a function of the first 50 tokens, *not* of token 51.

    "Each head does the following:\n",
    "* Produces an **attention pattern** for each destination token, a probability distribution of prior source tokens (including the current one) weighting how much information to copy.\n",
    "* Moves information (via a linear map) in the same way from each source token to each destination token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each attention head is made up of three components: the keys, queries, and values (often abbreviated as K, Q and V). These names come from their analogy to retrieval systems. Broadly speaking:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Queries** represent a question or request for information, e.g. \"I'm looking for a name that appeared earlier in this sentence\".\n",
    "* **Keys** represent whether a source token's information matches the query, e.g. if the source token is \"Mary\" then this causes the key to have a high dot product with the query (we call this an **attention score**), and it means that a lot of information will be taken from this token.\n",

Standard convolution layers work by imposing a \"prior of locality\", i.e. the assumption that pixels which are close together are more likely to share information. Although language has some locality (two words next to each other are more likely to share information than two words 100 tokens apart), the picture is a lot more nuanced, because which tokens are relevant to which others depends on the context of the sentence. For instance, in the sentence `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`, the names in this sentence are the most important tokens for predicting that the final token will be `\"Mary\"`, and this is because of the particular context of this sentence rather than the tokens' position.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, we unembed!\n",

    "This just consists of applying a linear map $W_U$, going from final residual stream to a vector of logits - this is the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Aside - tied embeddings</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - sometimes we use something called a **tied embedding** - this is where we use the same weights for our $W_E$ and $W_U$ matrices. In other words, to get the logit score for a particular token at some sequence position, we just take the vector in the residual stream at that sequence position and take the inner product with the corresponding token embedding vector. This is more training-efficient (because there are fewer parameters in our model), and it might seem principled at first. After all, if two words have very similar meanings, shouldn't they have similar embedding vectors because the model will treat them the same, and similar unembedding vectors because they could both be substituted for each other in most output?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is actually not very principled, for the following main reason: **the direct path involving the embedding and unembedding should approximate bigram frequencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down this claim. **Bigram frequencies** refers to the frequencies of pairs of words in the english language (e.g. the bigram frequency of \"Barack Obama\" is much higher than the product of the individual frequencies of the words \"Barack\" and \"Obama\"). If our model had no attention heads or MLP layers, then all we have is a linear map from our one-hot encoded token `T` to a probability distribution over the token following `T`. This map is represented by the linear transformation $t \\to t^T W_E W_U$ (where $t$ is our one-hot encoded token vector). Since the output of this transformation can only be a function of the token `T` (and no earlier tokens), the best we can do is have this map approximate the true frequency of bigrams starting with `T`, which appear in the training data. Importantly, **this is not a symmetric map**. We want `T = \"Barack\"` to result in a high probability of the next token being `\"Obama\"`, but not the other way around!\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in multi-layer models, a similar principle applies. There will be more paths through the model than just the \"direct path\" $W_E W_U$, but because of the residual connections there will always exist a direct path, so there will always be some incentive for $W_E W_U$ to approximate bigram frequencies.\n",

    "* Then applies an elementwise scaling and translation\n",

LayerNorm is only applied immediately before another linear map (either the MLP, or the query/key/value linear maps in the attention head, or the unembedding $W_U$). Linear compose linear = linear, so we can just fold this into a single effective linear layer and ignore it.\n",
    "    * `fold_ln=True` flag in `from_pretrained` does this for you.\n",
    "* LayerNorm is annoying for interpretability - it would be linear if not for the fact we divide by the variance, so you can't decompose the contributions of the input to the output independently. But it's *almost* linear - if you're changing a small part of the input you can pretend $\\sqrt{\\text{Var}[x] + \\epsilon}$ is constant, so the LayerNorm operation is linear, but if you're changing $x$ enough to alter the norm substantially it's not linear.\n",

    "    * Dot product every *pair* of queries and keys to get attn_scores `[batch, head_index, query_pos, key_pos]` (query = dest, key = source)\n",
    "    * **Scale** and mask `attn_scores` to make it lower triangular, i.e. causal\n",
    "    * Softmax along the `key_pos` dimension, to get a probability distribution for each query (destination) token - this is our attention pattern!\n",
    "* **Step 2:** Move information from source tokens to destination token using attention pattern (move = apply linear map)\n",
    "    * Linear map from input -> value `[batch, key_pos, head_index, d_head]`\n",
    "    * Mix along the `key_pos` with attn pattern to get `z`, which is a weighted average of the value vectors `[batch, query_pos, head_index, d_head]`\n",

The purpose of this is to avoid vanishing gradients (which is a big problem when we're dealing with a function like softmax - if one of the values is much larger than all the others, the probabilities will be close to 0 or 1, and the gradients will be close to 0).\n",

    "* The objects in the box are activations; they have a batch dimension (for simplicity, we assume the batch dimension is 1 in the diagram). The objects to the right of the box are our parameters (weights and biases); they have no batch dimension.\n",
    "* We arrange the keys, queries and values as `(batch, seq_pos, head_idx, d_head)`, because the biases have shape `(head_idx, d_head)`, so this makes it convenient to add the biases (recall the rules of array broadcasting!)."

    "\n",
    "The **QK** circuit consists of the operation of the $W_Q$ and $W_K$ matrices. In other words, it determines the attention pattern, i.e. where information is moved to and from in the residual stream. The functional form of the attention pattern $A$ is:\n",

    "\n",
    "The **OV** circuit consists of the operation of the $W_V$ and $W_O$ matrices. Once attention patterns are fixed, these matrices operate on the residual stream at the source position, and their output is the thing which gets moved from source to destination position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows the functional form of the OV circuit. The QK circuit (pink) is responsible for causing the destination token to attend to the source token, and the OV circuit (light brown) is what actually maps the source token data into the information we'll send to the destination token.\n",

The start of the **Training loop** section is most important, and the subsections on [Modularisation](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#modularisation) and [dataclasses](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#aside-dataclasses) are also very useful. Lastly, we'll also be using Weights and Biases to train our model - you can read about how to use it [here](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.4]_Optimization#what-is-weights-and-biases). Here are (roughly) all the things you should know for the following exercises:\n",
    "                \n",
    "* The key parts of a gradient update step are:\n",
    "    * Calculating the (cross-entropy) loss between a model's output and the true labels,\n",
    "    * `loss.backward()` - calculate gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters,\n",
    "    * `optimizer.step()` - update the model parameters using the gradients,\n",
    "    * `optimizer.zero_grad()` - zero the gradients so they don't accumulate.\n",
    "* We can nicely package up training loops into a class, which includes methods for training and validation steps among other things. This helps with writing code that can be reused in different contexts.\n",
    "* We can use dataclasses to store all the arguments relevant to training in one place, and then pass them to our trainer class. Autocompletion is one nice bonus of this!\n",
    "    * Be careful of scope here, you want to make sure you're referring to `self.args` within the trainer class, rather than the global `args`.\n",
    "* You can use Weights and Biases to track experiments and log relevant variables. The three essential functions are:\n",
    "    * `wandb.init()` - initialize a new run, takes arguments `project`, `name` and `config` (among others).\n",
    "    * `wandb.log()` - log a dictionary of variables, e.g. `{\"loss\": loss}`. Also takes a `step` argument.\n",
    "    * `wandb.finish()` - called at the end of training (no arguments)."

    "* We've given you the argument `max_steps_per_epoch`, a hacky way of making sure the training phase in each epoch doesn't go on for too long. You can terminate each training phase after this many steps. It's set to a default value that should lead to a very short run demonstrating nontrivial model performance.\n",
    "* Remember to move tokens to your device, via `tokens.to(device)` (this should be a global variable, defined at the top of your notebook).\n",
    "* You can refer back to the training loops from the [previous chapter of the course](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#training-loop) if you'd like.\n",
    "* We've also provided an instance of the `TransformerSampler` class so you can generate text from your model during training to see how it's doing. We will cover how sampling works in the next section."

    "\n",
    "In beam search, we maintain a list of size `num_beams` completions which are the most likely completions so far as measured by the product of their probabilities. Since this product can become very small, we use the sum of log probabilities instead. Note - log probabilities are *not* the same as your model's output. We get log probabilities by first taking softmax of our output and then taking log. You can do this with the [`log_softmax`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.log_softmax.html) function / tensor method.\n",

    "where $C = \\log \\sum_j \\exp(x_j)$ is the same for all elements. So we can see that $l_i$ is equal to the logit output $x_i$ after being translated by $C$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Logit output is translation invariant. If we had two different beams and we were generating the next tokens in those beams, there would be no reasonable way to compare the two beams to each other, because we could shift the logit vector for one beam by a constant amount without changing the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration, we run the batch of completions through the model and take the log-softmax to obtain `d_vocab` log-probs for each completion, or `num_beams * d_vocab` possible next completions in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we kept all of these, then we would have `num_beams * d_vocab * d_vocab` completions after the next iteration which is way too many, so instead we sort them by their score and loop through from best (highest) log probability to worst (lowest).\n",
    "\n",
    "The illustration below might help (based on real results from this method). Here, we have the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num_beams = 3\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info-arena/ARENA_img/main/misc/beam-search-3.png\" width=\"1000\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how after each \"generate\" stage, we have `num_beams ** 2` possible completions, which we then filter down to `num_beams`. This is because we need this many in order to find the best `num_beams` completions overall - for example, it's possible that all the best beams of length `n+1` come from the same beam of length `n`, in which case we'll need to keep all `num_beams` that we generated from that single beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we deal with sequences that terminate early (i.e. by generating an EOS token)? Answer - we append them to the list of completions which we'll return at the end, and remove them from the generation tree. Our algorithm terminates when either all our sequences have length `max_new_tokens` larger than the initial prompt length, or we've generated `num_returns_sequences` terminating sequences."

    "### Exercise - implement `beam_search`\n",

    "> Importance: 🔵⚪⚪⚪⚪\n",

    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've given you one implementation of `beam_search` below, which calls the `generate` and `filter` methods of the `Beams` class (these correspond to the two stages in the diagram above). The `beam_search` method works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a list `final_logprobs_and_completions` for storing the final output, as tuples of (logprob sum, string completion).\n",
    "- Perform `max_new_tokens` steps of generation (producing a new set of beams) and filtering (getting the best beams from these combinations), while also adding terminated beams to the list of best beams\n",
    "- Return these terminated beams plus the best ones we have at the end of the steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "So all you need to do is fill in the `generate` and `filter` methods. Below, you'll find some unit tests for the `generate` and `filter` methods. When you've passed these tests, you should be able to run the full `beam_search` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note** - by default, beam search produces a lot of repeated words / phrases / sentences. This makes sense - if the model finds some completion with a much higher logit sum than most completions in its beam search space, then it will want to repeat this completion even if it doesn't make a lot of sense in context. A common solution is to ban repetition of n-grams, which you should also implement in the function below. In other words, rather than sampling tokens from each sequence by taking `logprobs.topk(k)` in your `generate` method, you should take the `k` top tokens after filtering out those that give you repeated n-grams of length `no_repeat_ngram_size`. Good values of this parameter to try are 2 or 3 (although we recommend you try without this parameter first, so you can see how much of a difference it makes!)."

    "You may find that your cache implementation provides a modest speedup, but probably not close to the `seq_len`-factor speedup you'd expect from the fact that you only compute one additional token at each step rather than all of them. Why is this? The answer is that, much like everything to do with computational and memory costs in deep learning, it's not so simple. There are a host of different factors which might be bottlenecking our model's forward pass speed. If you try this on the CPU, you should get a much more noticeable speedup.\n",
